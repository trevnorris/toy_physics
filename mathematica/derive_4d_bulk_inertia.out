--- 1. Geometric Setup ---
Laplacian Check (should be 0): 0
--- 2. Solving for Dipole Strength Astrength ---
Dipole Strength Asol: a^4/3
--- 3. Integrating Bulk Kinetic Energy ---
Total Bulk Kinetic Energy Tbulk: (a^4*Pi^2*rho*V^2)/12
--- 4. Extracting Kappa ---
Effective Bulk Mass mEff: (a^4*Pi^2*rho)/6
Reference Cavitation Mass (3D): (4*a^3*Pi*rho)/3
====================================
RESULTING KAPPA_PV: (a*Pi)/8
====================================
(Check: Kappa relative to 4D displaced mass): 1/3
