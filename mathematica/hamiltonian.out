--- EXPANDING ACCELERATION TO 1PN ORDER ---
Acceleration x-component (a_x):
((2*chi + G*m*M*Sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + z^2])*(2*alpha*chi*x - c^2*m*x*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + alpha*m*(vxSym^2*x*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2*vxSym*(vySym*y + vzSym*z)*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - x*(-2*G*M*Sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + z^2] + vySym^2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + vzSym^2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)))))/(c^2*m^2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^3)

--- CHECKING FOR DRAG TERMS ---
Coefficient of Velocity (Drag Check):
(2*alpha*(vySym*y + vzSym*z)*(2*chi + G*m*M*Sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + z^2]))/(c^2*m*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2)

--- DIAGNOSIS ---
If the Hamiltonian is correct, this acceleration derives from a conserved energy.
Even if velocity terms appear, they must be conservative (symplectic).
