=================================================
   4D HYPER-CYLINDER (TUBE) INERTIA TEST       
=================================================

--- 1. Setup ---
Laplacian Check (should be 0): 0

--- 2. Boundary Condition ---
Dipole Strength Asol (Standard 3D Sphere): a^3/2

--- 3. Integrating Bulk Kinetic Energy ---
Total Kinetic Energy (Infinite Cylinder Approx): (a^3*L*Pi*rho*V^2)/3

--- 4. Extracting Kappa ---
Effective Bulk Mass mEff: (2*a^3*L*Pi*rho)/3
Reference Displaced Mass (Tube): (4*a^3*L*Pi*rho)/3
====================================
RESULTING KAPPA (Tube): 1/2
====================================

--- Interpretation ---
RESULT: 1/2. The tube behaves like a stack of spheres.
