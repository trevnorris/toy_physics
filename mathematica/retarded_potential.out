--- Expansion of the True Retarded Potential (PhiTotal) ---
-(mu/R) - (mu*nDotV)/(cs*R) - (mu*nDotV^2)/(cs^2*R)

--- PhiTotal in Current Text (Static Limit Check) ---
Static Limit (should be -mu/R): (-2*mu)/R

--- Corrected PhiL (Lag Potential) ---
-((mu*nDotV)/(cs*R)) - (mu*nDotV^2)/(cs^2*R)

--- Leading order of Corrected PhiL ---
Does it vanish in static limit (cs->infinity)? True
